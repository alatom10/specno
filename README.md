Running the application
- To run the application  use npm run start
- build folder has been created for production deployment to firebase (TODO)



Future Enhancements:

- move the employee search bar to it's own component to prevent additional rerenders of the current component.
- rework memoized components.
- add error boundaries.
- remove manual calls to firebase for data changes and implement sagas or react-redux-firebase to leverage a constant sync.
- move colours and avatars to database for custom selection. 
- further component rework.
